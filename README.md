# Write-ups

A collection of write-ups of challenges I completed on different platforms like Hack the box and capture the flag events like the Nixu Challenge. Most of the earlier write-ups were done in preparation of the OSCP exam and are, where possible, done without the use of Metasploit, SQLMap or other tools that are not allowed in the OSCP exam.

More write-ups might appear over time. Most likely they will be from newly retired Hack the Box machines.
